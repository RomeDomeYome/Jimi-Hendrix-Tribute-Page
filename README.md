# Jimi-Hendrix-Tribute-Page
Part of the Freecodecamp Responsive Web Design course projects.

Tribute page project from free code camp
The project is to create tribute page that is similar
to this one: https://tribute-page.freecodecamp.rocks/ 

Project has requirements based off these parameters:

I chose to just make a simple tribute to my favorite guitarist, Jimi Hendrix. It hit all the requirements for FCC but I decided to just add a little favorite songs list
and some links to his performances.
